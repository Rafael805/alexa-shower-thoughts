# Alexa Shower Thoughts 
Access some intriguing shower thoughts in an instant.

# Inspiation 
Often times, when we shower, the deepest thought-provoking questions come to our mind. Why wait until shower time to be deeply fascinated by eye-opening thoughts? We decided to create an Alexa skill that tells you a shower thought upon command.

# What it does
This Alexa skill allows the user to ask Alexa for a shower thought. For example, a user may activate the skill by saying, "Alexa, open Shower Thoughts" and then saying, "tell me a shower thought". Alexa then responds with a shower thought that is randomly chosen from a Reddit "Shower Thought" forum.

# How we built it
The Alexa skill was built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda function with Node.js 6.10

# What's next for Alexa Skill - Shower Thoughts
Adding a feature where a user can add their own shower thought to the list which will then be automatically posted to the Reddit "Shower Thoughts" forum.
